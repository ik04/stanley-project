in the server/rest dir

php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan storage:link
php artisan serve
```

in client/web dir

npm i
npm run dev

open 127.0.0.1:3000 to make sure everything works

- i haven't handled the errors in fe and it will be done in the future

## DB:

- during the migrate command say yes

good luck
